Original review

OK, the core of the game is brilliant. Sadly, I can't recommend it now (as of patch 1.02). I disregarded all the technical reviews where a lot of people complained about performance. Most of them didn't run the game on the highest end hardware, so I thought - hey, my specs are better, certainly my hardware will manage. No. This is definitely not subjective, not specific to only my software/hardware, as you can see all over the Internet - people with 20 series and 30 series are having the same problems as I am.

I have STRIX RTX 3090 OC, i5-12600K, 32 gigs of DDR5 and WD Black SN850. I also have the latest video card drivers (the ones that explicitly mention Elden Ring support), the latest Windows 10 updates. The game manages to drop frames as low as 40 on pretty much any settings. I also have VRR monitor and it helps but not much - I can perceive frame drops without any FPS counters as it reflects on the gameplay. It's especially noticeable in the open-world areas and affects not only the visual fluidity but also the flow of the battle for me. Basically, not only the frame-rate drops make it harder to time a dodging roll just because the game suddenly stutters right during a boss attack, it also directly translate to input lag where pressing a button does not immediately result in a corresponding action. This game requires precision and the stutter cripples that. In &quot;dungeons&quot; (literal dungeons or areas behind the fog) it runs pretty well.

It's beyond ridiculous. If you have the chance, go for the console version, if you don't, just wait for some patches.

Some additional information for more clarity.

GeForce driver 511.79 (has &quot;Game Ready for Elden Ring&quot; in the release notes)

Things I've tried in the game settings.
- Changing pretty much every setting from lowest to max
- 2160p resolution
- 1440p resolution - pretty much the same issues. I mean, on RTX 3090 - what the bloody hell

Now, it's a D2D12 game, so it has direct access to low-level APIs, which means I had little hope in any of the suggestions found online would help, but it didn't take me too long to try, so I did:
- The &quot;High performance&quot; thing in Graphics Settings of Windows
- Unlimited &quot;Shader Cache Size&quot; in NVIDIA settings
- Disabling &quot;Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator&quot;

None of the above resulted in a smooth experience. Basically, whatever is causing the stutter, would cause the stutter no matter what settings I had. I can run at 1080 with lowest settings and get stutters at exactly the same places as with 2160p and maximum settings. The game is not bottlenecked by any of my hardware, it's something wrong about the way the developers used D3D12, it seems.

Out of curiosity, I've underpowered my GPU (from power target 100% to 80%), lowered GPU boost clock from 1860 MHz to 1674 MHz. Listen to this - no effect on the performance whatsoever! I mean, Elden Ring was actually utilizing the GPU to the max and stuttering. Now it works absolutely the same with significantly underpowered GPU.

Now, as for comparison to XSX version, as I've played it a bit more now.

- Initial loading time (continue from main menu) is twice as slow on Xbox Series X as on my PC! This is a bummer.

- Looks like loading time on death are slightly better than the initial loading, but it's still much slower than that of PC.

- In open-world the resolution is very noticeably lower than 2160p. Furtermore, the frame-rates are very eager to drop. My current go-to for testing is the very early Tree Sentinel fight. On PC it's jarringly bad. On XSX, in addition to having sub-4K resolution, the frame-rate here goes pretty low but it doesn't feel that bad with VRR. I actually almost killed the boss with the initial-level character on my first attempt on XSX. On PC I struggled to kill him even after gaining levels and downing Margit - only because of the major stutter.

In conclusion, please don't give money to this kind of developer. I see already that the game sold very well on PC and it's sad. I mean, who forced the company to release the PC version without properly testing it? I am awfully sure, they were aware of the performance issues when they released it (otherwise they had zero testing, which is even worse). Why not release the console versions first and delay the PC version?

Also, I scanned the Steam forums/reviews and there are still plenty of people claiming they have a smooth experience. At this point, I don't believe they do. By now I know some people tend not to pay attention. I've seen plenty of people - before current-gen consoles - claiming they are totally happy with 30 FPS in their games and saying that 60 does not improve the game. Now look - since the PS5 and XSX started having plenty of games supporting higher frame rates, the console crowd is loving it and complainign about new games running at 30 FPS. Now people are saying that anything higher than 60 is unnecessary and not even perceivable (yeah, right). In a couple of generation the consoles will have 120 FPS in plenty of games and people will enjoy that.</textarea>
