However, that has come with a few caveats... so let's get into it. The Elden Ring won't fix itself, after all.

[i]&quot;Maybe you aren't a shadow
on the water...&quot;[/i]

The gods have fallen in a sort of Ragnarok and, awakening in The Lands Between, you start as a pathetic nobody. Barely scratching the first enemy you come across, that addictive Souls progression begins as you set out into the world to fix it the only way you know how: by killing. Lots of killing. Just like real life.

It should come as no surprise that The Lands Between are gorgeous to behold. With so many diverse biomes, a day/night cycle and changing weather system, From has made the transition to fully open world without compromising their unrivalled world design. The art direction is equally stellar.

It feels great to just wander off and explore, winding up in a cave and then fighting a boss that feels like a secret you uncovered yourself. From massive castles to tightly-packed crypts to winding underground mines, [i]Elden Ring[/i] feels like a &quot;Best Of&quot; collection for everything the Soulsborne games have explored before.

And, before you ask, yes... there are poison swamps. Don't worry.

While the world has some areas with empty space occupied by little more than trees or sheep and not every location receives the same amount of love, the sheer amount of content and variety here is staggering. Fortunately, there's now a mount to make journeys much faster - and with mounted combat to boot.

One of the concerns I had going into [i]Elden Ring[/i] was whether the open-ended design would hamper the boss fights and overall difficulty. Thankfully, in most cases, this isn't a problem.

The world is not levelled, so you're more than welcome to wander into some later areas, only to be smashed or barely make a dent. The opposite is also true, where you can annihilate an early boss much later into the game.

As mentioned already, the amount of bosses here is unrivalled with plenty hidden away in addition to the ones central to progression. There's not an over-reliance on using one type either, with moves that are more than happy to put your skills to the test.

If you do find yourself dying over and over again, then it's perfectly valid to come back later and check out another place in the meantime. This makes [i]Elden Ring[/i] rewarding to play and explore, no matter which direction you're coming from.

Class archetypes and the classic levelling system is back and better than ever as well. Combat is a lot of fun, especially if you ditch the shield and go on the offensive, and skills can now even be installed into a weapon, adding to experimentation and build variety.

[i]Elden Ring[/i] has also expanded on the multiplayer elements. There's full co-op now, in addition to boss summons and invasions, but the real change is in the spirit summons... essentially a separate ability path with different types of spirit ashes found throughout the world that can be used when needed.

To be clear, I haven't actually played with any of this yet, first playthrough has been purely solo, but the choice of PvE and PvP options is obviously going to be helpful for people who enjoy that sort of thing.

Despite the petty complaints about graphical fidelity in the lead-up to release, [i]Elden Ring[/i] also looks great. The dark fantasy aesthetic works really well here, with the clear influence of [i]Berserk[/i] a highlight, and it's hardly a lazy copy of the older games.

We finally have good character customisation as well, with no more shiny, jagged hair and plastic skin. As someone who spends way too long making characters in games, this is a huge improvement over the previous entries.

Finally, it should go without saying that the score is fantastic. Yuka Kitamura is back along with some newer contributors that once again nail the epic feeling of your journey. From's soundtracks never disappoint.

So what about the negatives?

Well, in addition to upgrading weapons as usual, [i]Elden Ring[/i] unfortunately has a crafting system. This means you'll now be picking up rubbish, mushrooms and bits of animal meat like it's an Early Access survival game.

While I haven't experimented with it much, crafting seems kinda pointless in the game, like most titles it's added to. The ingredients are useful for selling, at least, but it feels wrong to fight your way through enemies and all you get for the effort is a rare type of flower.

There's already tonnes of great loot on offer which are found normally or bought; crafting is unnecessary since there's merchants scattered around the place to sell the same items. I do like the Physick system, however, where you can mix effects to create custom potions. The Tear loot is rare, so it feels rewarding as a result.

While the mounted combat is surprisingly good and also helps with traversing the world, it's unfortunately an easy way to cheese a lot of fights.

Anyone who's played [i]Dark Souls[/i] before knows that circle-strafing was an issue. It's back again, except now it's much worse because you can run circles around a boss much faster and hack away at them, so long as the mount is allowed in that area.

Sure, you can argue that you don't [i]have[/i] to do this, but for all that work that goes into animation, it's going to be an easy crutch for players. Not a fatal flaw by any means, since move variety means that bosses won't let you get away with it for long, but it's still a problem.

Another issue is fall damage being inconsistent and not providing feedback. Sometimes you'll be able to land without taking damage and other times you'll die despite using the mount's double jump before hitting the ground which should slow momentum.

An easy way to fix this would be making Torrent whinny or something whenever the player tries to jump off a ledge that might kill them. Collision is also a bit buggy, where it's possible to land, keep moving and then the fall damage registers.

[i]Elden Ring[/i] also hasn't launched in the best state. I didn't run into these issues, but it's clear a lot of people have which is disappointing, considering the hype surrounding the game.

Some smaller nitpicks are the fact you have to reuse the summon item to dismount Torrent every time. Maybe I'm missing something, but this is needlessly clunky, especially if you're just jumping off briefly.

The Lands Between is their best world to date. If you've missed the interconnected level design of the original [i]Dark Souls[/i], it's on full display here. From really has gone all out on this and cemented their place as the best in the business.
