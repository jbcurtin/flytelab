[h1] Positives [/h1]

Exploration is very fun. There is a lot to find in the game world, and almost every dungeon or ruin has a useful reward in it, and even if the boss doesn't reward you with a useful item, you might find something useful in the dungeon itself.

The locations are quite varied. You've got a land afflicted by disease, a decrepit castle, keep in the middle of a poisonous swamp, a manor in the middle of a volcano, an ancient city torn apart by the elements, and many others. All of them have unique threats and environmental hazards to deal with, which ensures that the player never gets bored.

The game is pretty. While at a closer look it is a bit dated, artdesign carries the game.

There's a big variety of weapons, armors and spells. In addition to the new Ashes of War system (basically weapon arts from DS3) this lets the player customize their character to a level we've never seen before. There are also fewer redundant items than in previous titles made by the developer. Almost every weapon or tool has their use, and shields are once again a viable option for defence after being butchered in Dark Souls 3.

Performance is still questionable.
