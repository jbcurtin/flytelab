																<div class="content ">Firstly, this game is absolutely adorable and really simple, especially for an assembly game. The graphics were well done and the music was nice. I loved the voice acting as well. The story is very simple and told in a storybook-like manner in between the puzzles. There's not much to the story, but it doesn't make it any less nice or enjoyable. I didn't experience any issues or bugs while playing this game. My only issue with the game is that it's very short and I would love a lot more things to fix and assemble! <br><br>Overall, this is a very short game and felt even shorter when one gets immersed into the story (I'd love to fix more objects, please!). If you enjoy casual or assembly games or even looking for a short game, then I definitely recommend this game!								</div>

																<div class="content ">This is a pretty simple solitaire game that offers both regular klondike style and Las Vegas style. There are game settings that can be adjusted, such as 1 or 3 card draw or having the round be winnable or random. However, the game is still generally simplistic and there really isn't much to it. But, that doesn't mean that this isn't a fun simple solitaire game (although I was never and still am not a fan of Las Vegas style). I didn't experience any problems or issues with the game itself (I did have some issues with achievements at first, but the devs were extremely nice and quick to help). <br><br>Overall, if you're a fan of solitaire/card games, then I'd suggest giving this game a try.								</div>

																<div class="content ">So, this was a game that has no dialogue and relies on both graphics and the player to make connections and inferences to understand the story. For a pretty heavy topic (<span class="bb_spoiler"><span>death of a loved one</span></span>, it does a good job with balancing emotions. The story revolves around the character going through all stages of grief, which I think the game portrays pretty well. But, since the game does rely on graphics and being able to make those connections, it might not be as impactful for those that haven't experienced the same/similar kind of event in real life. The art was done very well, and I really liked the idea of the lover being an &quot;owl&quot;, which just adds on to the whole surrealism of the game. The music was also really nice and very fitting for the graphics. <br><br>There are some puzzles within the game, most are pretty easy. I only got stuck on two of them, one being the red box thing in the café and the other was the clock lock puzzle. It took me too long to figure out what I needed to do for the red box, but was at least able to figure it out and it did make sense to me. The clock lock puzzle, I was just completely lost. I ended up just moving the clock hands randomly until it clicked. I had no issues with any other puzzles. The biggest issue I had with the game was mainly just the moving border was a tad bit too much for me. It was a little too fast and a bit distracting. I really only felt a bit off during the prologue with the items (like the chair and desk) not lining up with the room's angle. I just had to focus on not looking at the border and it wasn't as bad in the later chapters. It might honestly just be me, but it would be nice to get an option to either slow that border down or turn its movement off. <br><br>Overall, I had fun playing this game. I did end up feeling a little sad after playing the game but that is, of course, due to the game's topic. So, if you are easily affected by sad or emotional topics, just be aware. It doesn't go too in-depth with the topic, but it does have the player make inferences and connections. It is short, and I was able to beat it under 3 hours. I definitely would recommend this game, especially for fans of the shorter point and click games.								</div>

																<div class="content ">Firstly, I had hoped that this game would have been as relaxing as it looked like, and I was not disappointed. The game was very calming both in it's casual gameplay and the background music. The graphics were amazing and well done for pixel art. I am a huge fan of that art style so typically any of that kind will catch my eye, but this game offers more detailed pixel graphics. The story was subtle as it was not meant to be the forefront of the game (the unpacking and organizing was the main point). However, there is enough hints to get the gist of what had happened. I was a little bit lost in the timeline only because I ended up not paying attention to the dates as much as I should have. But, by the last stage, everything came together and made a lot more sense. So, I would say while the story is subtle and if you don't read like me, it still would be hard for someone to get lost in the story. There are some bits of the story that does make the player make inferences or fill in the gaps themselves (such as with the <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>walking stick</span></span>). <br><br>I didn't experience bugs/problems with the game, but I did have a small issue with the game, which was the fact that I couldn't place items where I wanted them to go and had to do more rearranging than I liked to be able to pass the stage. I didn't realize until I beat the game that there was an option to turn off the puzzle mode, which allows for more freedom in the placement of items. This is no fault of the devs, just simply me not looking at the options. It is also nice that there is an option to change the highlight color as well as the size (of what I assume is for font size). <br><br>Overall, it was a very fun experience. Personally, I don't see any replay value for myself in this game unless more content is added. However with how relaxing the game is and the fact that you can switch out of puzzle mode, it is a game that can offer replay value for certain people. Now, the price point is a bit high for this game. Is it worth it? Yes, by all means, but if you're someone who is a bit more cautious with their spending, maybe wait for a sale. I'd still recommend it either way. It is a very nice and relaxing game for those that love casual games.								</div>

																<div class="content ">So, as far as dating sims go, this one is a simple one with a lot of different endings. A little over half of them are pretty easy to figure out. I only had trouble figuring out a few (specifically with the guardian angel and magician), but perhaps they are connected to specific choices before their routes appear? I didn't have enough patience to really dive into the why on that one. That being said, I was glad that there was more than three main love interests for the main character because I was worried that a lot of the game was going to be fluff and non-love interest related stories/endings. I did enjoy reading the story and liked the various endings. The graphics were good and I did enjoy them, even though it did feel as if the chibi art didn't quite match up with the main graphics of the game. Don't get me wrong, the chibi art was cute and was used only during the endings anyway. <br><br>Before going on to the technical details of the game, I wanted to say that this game is full of references and puns. In the endings, in a few characters that you meet/see, etc. And I loved it. I loved that they got punny with the references as well (like &quot;Jurassic Tower&quot; killed me). <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>There is also a Slenderman and uh..tentacle &quot;death&quot;...that makes me see Slenderman in a new light...</span></span><br><br>Onto the issues I had with the game. I didn't experience any bugs. However, there were quite a few typos and just general phrasing that did need to be fixed (for example, in one part with the guardian angel, the game says that &quot;hopefully it's the latter,&quot; but the latter in that case was the character wishing the angel was only pretending to be serious...which I think they meant that it'd be better for him to understand how important it was). Overall, it was just little errors here and there, but it just shows that the game needs more proofreading, especially the further along you get in the routes. It was also odd to say that there was a quiet thank you but then had the words &quot;thank you&quot; in all caps, which is usually seen as yelling. Some of the choices didn't quite line up to the story itself (for example, during the wolf's route, if you choose to hide with the wolf but stay where you are, you don't actually see who had come around, but later in the route, your character says it was the hunter, but would have had no knowledge on that). <br><br>Besides grammar/phrasing/etc, I did notice that in some parts of the game, the text would be long and end up overlapping the textbox's border. Also, in the first parts of meeting the guardian angel, his halo would appear and disappear quite quickly, and I'm not sure if that was intentional or not. I couldn't figure out if it was supposed to be part of a specific emotion he was displaying in the story or what, but it was a bit weird to see. <br><br>Overall, the game offers a lot of routes, many of them being short and quick with others having a decent amount of text (without being overly long winded). If you're a fan of casual dating sims and various endings (and puns/references), I definitely would recommend this game.								</div>

																<div class="content ">So, this is a game where I'd prefer to give it an in between rating. The &quot;About This Game&quot; portion definitely does describe the game exactly when it says &quot;there is no clear goal to the game&quot;. It also does state that you just basically open drawers. That's the game, opening drawers. However, I'm a person who typically only looks at the information at the top along with pictures, but I pretty much skim before I play a game. I like to have a quick gist of what I could expect but prefer to experience the game going in blind. So, I was a bit surprised by the general lack of...well anything. I also didn't expect most of the game play to just be figuring out a pattern with the drawers. The game took less than 1 minute to beat. The pattern wasn't hard to figure out and was quick enough to beat. My issue lies mainly with the &quot;investigating your kitchen to see what secrets it holds&quot; makes the game sound as if there IS a secret, which there is none. As the game has no point or goal beyond getting to the credits. I'm mainly confused as to why the game is THAT short (I guess I just assumed the &quot;bite sized puzzle&quot; was in reference to the cereal in the pictures rather than it meaning that the puzzle itself is short and quick). Or rather, I'm surprised it doesn't have achievements, as I've really only seen short simple games being a way to throw achievements at people. Not that I'm asking for them, just simply surprised is all because it really is truly short.<br><br>The graphics were nice, and I did really enjoy them. I had no issues with the game whatsoever. Even with zero instructions, it's easy enough to figure out what needs to be done. For a short game, it definitely does not fail in that aspect. It would be nice to have some kind of music playing, as the game just feels a little oddly quiet, even with the sounds of the items and drawers. <br><br>Overall, it's less than 1 minute of gameplay (2 minutes if you're really really slow), and I feel that the dev's &quot;less than five minutes&quot; time was a bit overly optimistic. There's no replay value, but it's free. Would I recommend it? If you have no other game to play, go for it, but you'll be needing another game to play a minute later. Not missing anything by skipping this game, but also not experiencing anything by playing it either.								</div>

																<div class="content ">For a short horror VN, the game was pretty decent. I did enjoy reading the story, which was pretty straight forward and to the point for the most part. There were some bits that I was a bit confused by even though I could probably connect the dots (<span class="bb_spoiler"><span>specifically talking about the cat...</span></span>). There are three different endings, which I do like the variety. I also do like the route map and that different choices did slightly change a few things (though the endings themselves do not change). The graphics were great and I loved the sounds. <br><br>There were a few typos, which in a VN can be killer. Thankfully, there weren't a lot of them but the game did definitely need another round of proofreading. There was a line that wasn't translated into English (I did have to use a translation site to figure it out). In one of the routes, I believe it was for the 2nd ending, there was a line that mentioned seeing the tall figure under the spotlight, but I didn't make any choices where I had actually seen that figure for that playthrough. Sometimes, picking choices from the route map didn't work properly and it would keep showing me the &quot;Thanks for playing&quot; screen. <br><br>My main issue with the game was more along the lines of having no proper skip feature. It's not as bad for this game, since it is short and does offer an auto button. However, when I had gotten all the endings and I just wanted to see how the different choices would play out, it did become very slow and dragged on because I couldn't skip seen text.  <br><br>Overall, if you enjoy horror VNs or short VNs, then I would definitely give this game a try. It does have some small issues and no skip feature, but it's still an enjoyable story for horror fans. No jump scares, but there are some gore graphics, so perfect for the easily scared but tread lightly for the faint hearted.								</div>

																<div class="content ">I'm not quite sure if I enjoyed this game but I definitely don't think I disliked it. I played Locked Up before playing this game and the dev does show some progression but the same basic premise is used in both games. Walk around and/or interact with certain items to trigger the next event. The biggest plus is that this game has a running option! So, it makes the game feel a lot less sluggish than Locked Up. There was a part where you were actively chased, which I thought seemed a bit unnecessary and out of place. However, it did add in a bit of a different kind of suspense, but I didn't really like it. Unlike Locked Up, the main character can die which I did enjoy. <br><br>The story did take me a little bit to understand, and I didn't fully grasp what was going on until the very end of the game. I don't mind late plot twists but I was actually starting to not like the story up until the pieces fell into place and I was able to understand it. I also was getting so confused by what seemed to be a random circus/clown theme but it, too, made more sense as you played. However, that being said, once I got through the entire game, I did end up really enjoying the story and I do like the whole &quot;inner demon&quot; theme.<br><br>I didn't experience many bugs in the game, but the clown did get stuck during the circus level. It wasn't a bad bug, since I was able to move around the area with 0 fear that he would kill me. The loading did feel like it took longer than Locked Up, but I'm not 100% sure on that. Also, for most of the time, I wasn't able to switch tabs while the game was loading. The typos in this game did seem a bit more obvious than the ones I saw in Locked Up, for example &quot;I have to think about my behavior, but me only scarier here.&quot; <br><br>Overall, I did eventually enjoy the game. So, if you enjoy walking sim horrors where dying is possible and with some light chasing, then this game might be for you. I would highly suggest getting it on sale, though.								</div>

																<div class="content ">So, this was a game that I didn't hate but I wouldn't go so far as to say I loved the game, but I did enjoy playing it. The story itself was pretty good (given that it does play on the usual horror storylines). It was one of the games that doesn't tell you but rather has the player rely on finding hints and notes that flesh out the story for you. And it was done well enough to understand the story. It did throw me off for a bit, since the game did jump around in points of time, which makes it a bit hard to get what's going on in the beginning. I assume this is done intentionally. The game is a walking sim horror game, so I didn't expect to get scared as the player can't actually &quot;die&quot;. That being said, because it is only a walking sim, it relies a lot on jumpscares and tension to create the scary atmosphere. Most of the jumpscares were lacking, though some were done pretty well (not that it made them any scarier). The game is set in a very small enclosed area (a house with a handful of rooms that you can sometimes enter), so there is a LOT of walking back and forth (even intentional moments of walking back and forth just to trigger the next event). <br><br>My biggest issue with this game is that it seriously felt like my guy was some 95 year old man who couldn't walk too quickly or he'd break his back. Now, I understand that this is a walking sim but I'd settle for an option for a speed walk in this game, especially since some events were triggered by walking. I get it, it's supposed to build tension, but it honestly just felt more like a chore to walk. My tension was killed by my focus on how boring it was to slooowly move around.<br><br>Most of the sounds were done very well but there was only one sound that really grated on my ears, especially since I had my headphones on. It was a moment where there's a very high pitch noise and it was a bit too high for me. I didn't even notice that there was text at the very bottom of the screen sometimes. The text size is way too small. I really only noticed a few typos on the very last letter that you pick up in-game, such as &quot;anamnes&quot; which I'm pretty sure should be &quot;anamnesis&quot;. I also wasn't sure what &quot;she did away with herself&quot; means to the dev, but for me, it means that she killed herself. However, later on in the letter, you realize that she didn't kill herself, she just fell into hardships <span class="bb_spoiler"><span>after the guy goes to prison for the murder of the child</span></span>. So it's definitely something that needs a bit more proofreading, since it's kind of a big part to the story. <br><br>Overall, I can see this not being a game for some people. I did enjoy playing it, but I don't see any replay value at all. So, if you enjoy walking sims and horror games then I'd suggest giving this game a try if you can find it on sale.								</div>

																<div class="content ">A cute little Tamagotchi based game with more...I suppose light &quot;adult&quot; themes (well more adult than the original Tamagotchis anyway). Like the game it's based on, there's really not all that much to do in the game. You can check the status/health of the Beepis, clean it, feed or play with it, and give it items (like cigs, pills, and what I assume is beer). I'm not sure how many types of Beepis there are, but I only saw two. In the second stage, it definitely seems as if the Beepis eat poop as the poop catching game you play feeds or starves the Beepis, depending on how much poop you catch. The other minigame is a basic jumper that has the Beepis dodging broken glass and trash bags. Both of the minigames are decent enough, not too hard though the speed increase does keep it from being too easy. The graphics are pretty cute and I do like the fact that you can interact with the coins and move the Beepis gagdet around. The little capsules that pop out when you clean the poop does worry me a bit (but in a comical way of course). I do like that there are in-game achievements which does offer a bit more to the game, so it's not overly simple and gives the player extra things to do.<br><br>One of the only issues I had with the game was the fact that I didn't realize I could use the arrow keys, which made the minigames a lot easier to play than with mouse. So, it would've been nice to have a small in-game instruction page added to the little manual. I did see a few typos in-game but then realized that they were done on purpose, and I did like that it added to the Beepis appeal. I also found it a bit annoying not to see more of the tabletop or to at least have important items hit an invisible barrier, which would stop them from getting lost in the unseen parts of the table. I was messing around with the batteries for Beepis and may have accidentally threw them away and wasn't able to see them on the screen, which makes the game unplayable without reseting (which isn't a terrible issue for a simple game like this one, but it still makes it annoying).<br><br>Overall, the game is cute and simple, although there's not much to it which isn't surprising. The game itself is short as it doesn't take much time for the Beepis to get to the adult stage. If you're a fan of Tamagotchi type games, then I'd suggest giving this game a try.								</div>
