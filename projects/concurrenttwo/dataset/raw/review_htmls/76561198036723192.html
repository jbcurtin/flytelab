Before anyone rages or tells me &quot;You can do this to cheese X mob etc.&quot; I know, I know already, but are you supposed to have to cheese certain encounters because they're weirdly tuned just to save your sanity?

If you want to skip my rant examples scroll down to the bottom. :)

- Starting off:
I have grabbed a Platinum trophy in every single SoulsBorne From game except Demon's Souls (my PS3 died on me) and I have to say that Elden ring is probably the most unbalanced of them all so far sadly (due to the insane amount of open world / dungeon encounters).
Don't get me wrong, I am having fun, I'll play through it multiple times and I'll defo try some speedrunning tactics in this as well as always, but some boss fights seem to be punishing just to be punishing, are badly tuned with timings on attacks and the relentlessness of some of the mobs/bosses happens a tad too often and overall it feels like they've made the attacks say 20% faster than the dodges which makes the timings seem wonky and makes it feel really weird to dodge through attack chains.

It may just be me but, I always actively dodge using any form of summons for the first full run or two of every new game because I want to learn the fights properly, but it seems some of the fights are balanced around actually using your summon Ashes which is a big dislike since everyone who's played one of these games know that the bosses aggro/attack systems aren't really tuned for coop which leaves the bosses more unpredictable because they snap aggro with 180 turns mid attacks etc. anyway I digress as usual...

!!!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!
START RANT

The main encounters seem to have gotten a lot more love than their side area counterparts and they've been both impressive visually and mechanically although a few have been pretty easy (looking at you Rennala).

A few examples of what I mean of just bad enemy/boss design:
- Depraved Perfumer:
Weapon attacks are fine, the insane endless perfume skill spam (which seem to be near instant) is not, since it keeps clipping through walls, and objects etc. There are ways to beat them ofc, but they are more frustrating than fun to handle.

-  Black Knife Assassin fights:
Fought a bunch of these and even though they are annoying, they are easily manageable by just learning their patterns as per usual which is both fair and fun. Sticking one of them in a space that is smaller than my 1 room apartment is not, not because of the mob really, but with the insane amount of movement patterns this mob has, the camera clipping and angles of the fight just makes the fight a mess that isn't hard because of the encounter itself, but hard because of the same camera issues that's been around since 2009. Throw in the invisible fight to top it off with that obscure note you can find on a vendor telling you to buy a torch to make it visible just feels cheesy as well let's be honest. ^_^

- Twin Gargoyles:
This fight isn't hard per se, it just get's really annoying because of above mentioned ability spam. The attack RNG seem to get stuck in their loops at times and having two giant bosses (with their only lock on point being torso height making your camera spin up into the ceiling every time they jump you) just spam 6-9 (nice) hit combos without pause which are also off timing from your dodge roll just makes the boss a waiting game. Just run, run and run until they decide to stop with their whirlwinding/poison spewing spam and you get your shot for a few hits. Usually the bosses are designed with some sort window for you to take your opportunity to punish the boss back, but they get a bit few and far between on these guys since they just seem to be Black Blade Kindred with extra steps x 2. Add to it the 3 times the fight just bugged out on me and Boss 1 didn't want to come down from the ledge and fight me (after spending like 20 minutes shooting him down to half health) his buddy decided not to show up which soft locks the fight forcing you to restart the game or jump off the edge...

- Another few examples are the little side dungeons:
Sticking 1 Omen mob (hp is overtuned for sure which seem to be true on a lot of the mobs around the world) in a super tight space doesn't make the fight hard or challenging, it makes the fight extremely annoying due to the fact of camera issues as per usual, sticking a second one around the corner is fine to annoy you further, but fine, having that mob randomly aggro through the wall because of bad zoning is not.

What I'm getting at here is if you compare the game to say Sekiro, which is beautifully telegraphed, bosses are insanely well tuned and you can beat them in multiple ways without ever having to cheese them.
Dark Souls 3 had a few crappy encounters as well, but they are insanely few and far between them, Elden Ring seems like it just wasn't given the love and tuning it might have needed in all areas (especially side areas) and duplicating bosses and just sticking them in a smaller room or together with 15 other mobs  doesn't really make the fight more fun, interesting or challenging to me, it just makes the original boss design show it's flaws in a new badly optimized space (I know it happens in every game, but there they show up as just &quot;regular mobs&quot; after you spent a potentially few hours learning how to fight the boss version).

END RANT :)

- Visuals:
The visuals and design is amazing. Stepping into one of the first dungeons and just seeing that yanky movement of a watchdog in the dark creeped me out and made me smile at the same time. Standing and looking out over the vast open world and knowing that I can actually go to that tower off in the distance is amazing.

- Audio:
As amazing as ever (Queue boss music) though weirdly optimized at places, had a few cutscenes where the volume just pops up to eleven as if it just ignores my sound settings and found a few branches which when they snap sound like a building is coming crashing down.

- Replayability:
Heck yes, multiple endings, if you're not following some 100% guide I can guarantee you you've missed a quest chain or two and a couple of bosses / dungeons on your way through, then the plethora of weapons, spells and incantations will be extremely fun to play around with in different builds and that also opens up a ton of options for PvP. :)

- Would I recommend it?
If you've enjoyed any other Souls game YES, buy it, play it to your hearts content and beat the game with practice and knowledge.

If this is your &quot;First&quot; Souls game, then I'd seriously recommend you try Dark Souls 3 first for example, learn the game mechanics, how these games work, how the devs think in a more streamlined environment before going open world, heading in the wrong direction on the map might land you in a zone where you're really not supposed to be because of low levels/bad gear and you'll just get stomped for it and seeing as a lot of new players followed instructions and went straight for Margit, that will leave you having a bad time.</textarea>
