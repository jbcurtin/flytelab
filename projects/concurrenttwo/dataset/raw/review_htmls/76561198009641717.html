This review is more of a ramble listing off key changes and good features between this title and past FROMSOFT titles.

If you are unfamiliar with their games and their style of play, this review might not be the most helpful - but the short version is that it is an excellent action RPG with high difficulty and an extremely immersive environment for you to explore and succeed in.

Elden Ring so far is a great game. It builds off of the combat speed improvements of Dark Souls 3 and Sekiro to the FROMSOFT game formula, but adds many new features and a startling variety of enemies and large amount of build variety.

The open world takes some getting used to, but large numbers of mini-dungeons with their own unique minor boss make exploring quite enjoyable - as does finding random NPCs or treasure throughout the world. The world itself is stunningly beautiful, and often you can find dungeons or NPCs or treasure through things like audio cues or hints in the environment that could be easily missed. This encourages exploration in a way that games like this rarely do. In addition to dungeons, NPCs, and treasure in beautiful environments - there are area bosses that can simply show up in certain areas in the over-world, which you can choose to fight or ignore.

There is crafting in the game - and you can hunt down various crafting recipes through merchants and looting to create things like fire or bleeding arrows, fire bombs, and numerous other useful items. This crafting allows a person to more easily do things like bow builds with a good amount of variety, without needing to rely on merchant items or farming unreliable drops to get the necessary crafted items while out in the field. You can craft at any time you want quite easily as well.

The combat is greatly improved upon since Dark Souls 3. You can now jump vertically and do jumping attacks, and enemies can more realistically and reliably be staggered through mixing and moving your attacks properly. Weapons can be customized through &quot;Ashes of War&quot; to have various additional special moves (similar to weapon arts in Dark Souls 3, but better), and you can swap them out between weapons to make for a great variety of builds. My current build for example uses a rapier in the right hand with the heavy thrust ability to close gaps, and a scimitar in the left hand I use for faster strikes - two-handing it to get access to a blood slash that does heavy damage in a sweep in front of me. Mounted combat exists, and while it doesn't work as well as the on-foot combat - it can be useful from time to time.

Speaking of mounts - you get a mount in this game, which you can use in almost all area of the over-world (not in dungeons or certain limited areas, though). It isn't available in co-op, sadly enough. You can attack from horseback and while this can be engaging, you can't use weapon arts or all options from horseback so doing so is more limited. Still, your mount is very useful for getting across the decently sized open world, and you can loot items from the back of your noble steed as well to save time for where you really want to spend it.

Co-op is enjoyable, and you can do co-op in any area of the world. However, given that you cannot use your spectral mount in co-op and the fact that you can only do co-op within certain limited regions of the map in one go without resummoning (such as within a dungeon or within a section of the over-world), it is best to summon people only specifically when you need their help for going through a dungeon or clearing a world boss or such rather than summoning them at all times.

I have run into a handful of minor bugs as well. I once tried to get on my mount, and instead of getting on - I hovered in mid-air for about 20 seconds before just automatically dying. I never have had a bug actually ruin my fun in the game, but they definitely do seem to have more bugs in this game than I recall ever seeing in Sekiro or Dark Souls 3.

The combat, world design, characters, and just about every aspect of the game I have encountered are huge improvements of their formula - to the point that I honestly do not feel that the hype was unjustified at all (I tend to be pessimistic about these things).

Those are my thoughts. I recommend this game to anyone who has enjoyed past FROMSOFT games or similar games, and who is excited for the possibilities that having a more open world and more content can bring to the formula of Souls type games.

There are many negative reviews as of this writing - the vast majority of which cite performance concerns. The thing to remember with such concerns is that those with bad performance are a vocal minority who are bound to write bad reviews - justifiably - but this doesn't mean that you personally wouldn't be able to properly enjoy the game.
