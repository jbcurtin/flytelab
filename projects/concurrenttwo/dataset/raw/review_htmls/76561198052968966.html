																	<div class="early_access_review tooltip" data-tooltip-text="This review was written while Phasmophobia was marked as Steam Early Access">Early Access Review</div>
																<div class="content ">So this game is in early access which is partially why I'll be giving it a yes as the Devs have a lot of space to expand and improve. The game is a lot of fun, can be shockingly tense and scary despite being multiplayer, and it overall a great time. If the premise interests you I'd say you'll have a great time. However I want to go into depth where I think the game can improve so the devs can see that little piece of feedback.<br><br>First, repetition and longevity:<br>The game begins so strong, and it's a lot of fun. However within a few hours, and once you figure out certain things about certain items, it becomes routine to an almost saddening degree. This is how every hunt will go, regardless of spirit type. Scout location looking for EMF or temp readings, upon locateing the ghosts &quot;room&quot; drop a crusifix inside of the room and run back to trunk, unload as much junk as you want in the room, scanners, cameras, etc. Then proceed to antagonize the ghost either by being in the room or talking to it until you complete objectives and know what it is. That's it. No matter the spirit the core gameplay becomes identicle, the crusifix is your get out of jail free card, when it's down you can't be killed, and with that in mind it makes the gameplay extremely straight forward. However I don't think just weakening that item would fix anything, in fact I'd argue changing only it would make the whole game worse, and that is because...<br><br>The spirits. This style of game is going to rely on one thing more than anything else, and that's the enemies. The ghosts are what provide the gameplay and the variety, and right now it's simply not there. I saw the list of spirits and my mind went wild with the possibilities for what they could all be, how they could act, the amazing, weird things I might encounter! I was wrong. The spirits all act extremely similar if not the exact same. If they manifest theres a VERY small number of ways they can look, none unique to themselves as far as I could tell. It's always a bloodied person walking or a shadow person walking. That's really it no matter what mythical spirit you're brushing up against. This lack of variety along with how little the difference is in how they act in gameplay is truely a shame as without the variety in the spirits it makes that core gameplay feel even more drastically samey as you grow accustomed to the things that can and will happen. The only real differences are how often one spirit or another may do something. Otherwise they all do the same things, just some more than others, and the difference can be hard to pin down because of this homogenized style. This needs fixed, badly.<br><br>The other half of this equation is something more nuanced that I don't know how to label. Let's call it...<br><br>Gameplay focus/rewards and difficulty<br><br>So this is also something the game feels direly lost about. My friends and I played for 8 hours all told, in those 8 hours we only had a single person die. It was on our very first hunt. Since then not only has noone died, noone even came close. After a while the spirits begin to feel almost toothless as you understand the mechanics, which thus far don't go too deep, and realize what different signs mean. Now this may not sound like a problem, &quot;Of course I'd die less as I get better!&quot; But that isn't how it felt, we hadn't really gone from clueless to pros after that single first hunt. It's just too easy to survive, the spirits often feeling, as said before, toothless. But I know why this is. You lose all items but the default ones you get given to you that you brought on a mission upon death. So the devs have gone with a system of high punishment, low reward, and lower threat because of it. It's almost how minecraft treats death. Sure you lose everything when you die, but you will basically never die if you're careful.<br><br>I don't think this style fits this game. UPon winning a hunt, say a small hunt, you get base 40 dollars, plus an extra 20 if you got a photo of the spirit on still image camera. 60 bucks for hunts that can take some time. That's not enough enough for 2 doses of pills to restore sanity (which are consumables and are spent if you die or not). It buys you one video camera with no tripod. What I'm saying is the payout to missions is almost comically low to the points you can't restock lost goods all that fast should you die and lose a lot. I currently take enough gear into missions with friends that were I to die it would take me literally HOURS of real life work in the game to re-earn what I'd lose for one failure. Now, I understand what the devs hoped would come of this system, they hoped the threat would increase tension and make it feel scarier, making the threat of death a genuine concern. But that's now how it feels in practise. In practise it instead means that I just play it safe, follow the formula mentioned in a prior point, and never really have to worry. The system meant to add tension instead adds none, really.<br><br>The solution here I think is to revamp this structure. To begin with a game of this nature having some kind of rogue like/survival reward structure simply makes no sense to me. You're playing because it's fun to hunt ghosts, not to buy one more camera every hour. But I also think revamping this system would be important for one other reason; if the punishment for death is less dramatic, then you can ramp up the spectral aggression which would make the core reason you're ACTUALLY here more fun! There's a few ways they could go about changing this. one is to massively improve payouts for missions so replenishing lost goods isn't hard after a death. Another would be to simply not take things from players upon death, perhaps you only lose items if EVERYONE in the session dies, but not if only you personally do. Whatever form this change would take I think this is extremely important because being able to ramp up the activity of the enemies AI would make for much more exciting gameplay, without feeling pointlessly punishing since, as I said, the current progression system doesn't do anything to make the game feel better to play, it's more of a hinderance and a bother.<br><br>Overall though this is a strong foundation. I wish the devs well, but those 3 kind of points are key to making this from &quot;good for a few hours&quot; to &quot;Great, let's play this a ton!&quot;.<br><br>The enemies are the crown jewel of this kind of game. Make them unique, visually, mechanically, structurally, push what makes each one special.<br><br>The core loop is too similar hunt to hunt, add variety, drive decisions that will pull players into different action than simply camping one room of a house.<br><br>And restructure or remove the needless progression system since it's presence has knock on effects into the gameplay that can not be ignored.<br><br>OH and PS. increase the damned move speed. It makes the game absolutely unplayable on lager maps, takes it from a fun, spooky experience to a torturous slog. The fact there even IS a sprint button is baffleing as it's only a fraction faster than not sprinting. Make the current &quot;sprinting&quot; the default run, and then make an actually quick moving sprint, as it is there is NO reason not to hold down sprint for the ENTIRE game which is wildly uncomfortable  over extended periods, and considering there is absolutely no downside to sprinting that just leaves even more reason to perpetually crawl at the &quot;sprinting&quot; pace. Please improve movespeed. I know VR means you can't full on rocket sprint but the current speed is painful.								</div>

																<div class="content ">So I finished this game just a few days ago. And I've not stopped thinking about it since then. I hope perhaps that can get across how impactful this story was for me.<br><br>It's a beautiful, beautiful story, the characters are well written and enjoyable. but the main thing that has me hung up, still thinking on this game days after beating it is the relationship/writing and dynamics between the two main characters Amber and Marina.<br><br>I don't think I can express how much watching them made me feel, the voice actresses for both really added to this, I can't say how much, but I think the great performances by both shot the impact of it all through the roof.<br><br>This is a story that does more than tease a relationship for hours, than end on a kiss. This is a story about a real love. About self acceptance, about accepting your flaws, about letting another in, about letting yourself accept help.<br><br>It's a story that has a lot of strong, positive messageing, and it impacted me on a personal level pretty dang hard.<br><br>This is a story about all that I said above, but then it's a story about finding comfort in a new love, about that time when a relationship is still new, and both are trying to figure out how to act in it, I think the relationship is official for 1/3rd to maybe even a half the games runtime, which was a welcome change from most other romance media I've seen.<br><br>I wish I could find the words to say just how good, just how strongly this impacted me.<br><br>Buy this game, really, I mean it. It's worth more than it's asking.<br><br>And Devs? I've seen online you said someday you'd possibly revisit these girls and show more of their adventures, please, do. Even if it's years from now when your current projects are done, I and many others I think would love to see more of these two and their adventures, and their deepening of their love.								</div>

																<div class="content ">Edit, years later: <br><br>This game only got better This game is something <a class="bb_link" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://special.In" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" >special.In</a> my first review I mentioned this game needing time, it's intro being awkward. Well they now fixed that. It's still the &quot;least good part&quot; but that does NOT mean bad. This game is absolutely wonderful, the devs have remained for years now kind, considerate, consistant. Cared to their community, and most importantly, always improved. The fights, visuals, cutscenes, stories, EVERYTHING has improved expansion over expansion, with the latest, Shadowbringers, being a genuine masterclass of content and storytelling. Does this game try to reinvent the genre? No. Does it try to reinvent itself? No. But it DOES know precisely what it wants to be and tries to be the best version of itself it can possibly be. And after living through WoW's chaotic attempts to reinvent itself and the genre every expansion simple consistancy and predictability is precisely what I'd dream of, and now, have.<br><br>I could write a book on the many small and large things that make this game special, that makes me love it. But I won't, I can't. It couldn't accurately express what this has come to mean for me. All I would say is try it, please, its free trial goes up through the entirety of launch content AND the first expansion now which lets you see that amazing first jump in quality without spending a dime. It's an exceptional game, and worthy of of your time to give it a shot. Because I chose to on a whim, and via that random decision I found my own little home online, because that's what Eorzea has become to me, a home.<br><br>I'm precisely 4k hours in as of writing, and I will gladly play 4k more and beyond.<br><br>Here's to adding another edit at 8k.<br><br>Original review:<br><br>I've played MANY mmo's. I've a passion for the industry and always have, I've played since Everquest, I've played dozens of mmo's, some for years. I played WoW from Vanilla's tail end up until around WoD. But then I picked up this game.<br><br>It really is something special. At first I wasn't sure. It starts slow and a bit rocky, story is definately presented well but it's kinda off and on. But as I got further, the game's quality grew exponentially. And for the first time in what feels like ages, I felt a sense of child-like wonder at the world they were having me explore. It excited me to go to a new place, to see the next bit of story, to try a new class, a new activity. And now, several years later, that feeling persists. It is not a perfect game, none is. But these devs CARE. They listen, and you can see their hearts and souls poured into this game.<br><br>Depth is added to everything, crafting is it's own game, chocobo racing and breeding,, a full card game within the game, and so much side content I STILL have entire portions of the game I havn't touched in the slightest.<br><br>Would I recommend FFXIV? Absolutely. The only side ntoe I'd put on that recommendation is to give it some time. It's first impression can be awkward, but as it fills out it's really something special.								</div>

																<div class="content ">REVISED<br><br>So, I can now say that I would recommend this game is you want something casual to play that's a good bit different than your normal mobile game. It looks good, actually puts some effort into the story, and the gameplay si earnestly unique and enjoyable. I can give it a solid recommendation overall.								</div>

																<div class="content ">I will update mroe, as even this number of hours for a Bethesda title is small, but this is my review as it stands.<br><br>Pros:<br><br>- The art style is the best it's been, and while it's not the witcher three it is a beautiful game. It's world is desolate, but not monochrome as past entries. With vibrant colors and beautiful scenes.<br><br>- one I want to highlight specifically here is the visual story telling. Bethesda put who knows how many man hours itno this, but you almost can't go a place that desn't have some little narritive laid out in the objects of the world. be it a skeleton from the pre war, with a bag of money near a broken bank wall, having died in the explosions of the nukes shortly after robbing a bank. Or scraps of notes unrelated to any quests, along with bodies, objects, and ancient blood stains despicting a scene of betrayl, depression and fear. The visual story telling is the best I've seen in any game, it genuinely has impresed me, and continues to do something over 40 hours in.<br><br>- The gun play is the best it's been in the franchise, guns sound and feel amazing to shoot, along with enemies reactions to being shot and the much better rag dolls make for very satisfying combat.<br><br>- The weapon modding systems in game along with the legendary drops and the randomization of weapons and armor in a boderlands-esque manner make gear infinitely more interesting, and allow for continued interest in looting and checkign gear much farther into the game than in previous entries.<br><br>- te crafting system and the settlement building also add more longevity, as I find myself scavageing and really investigateing places to find materials I'd want and even returning to cleared places looking for certain materials I may have passed at the time.<br><br>- Power armor for the first time in any fallout game feels like the lore describes, you dont' just wear it all the time as a suit of fancy palte armor, it is now something that makes you a god, but has limited power, and so it's use is a meaningful and powerful event.<br><br>- Also the voice protagonist and the new way conversations are done, overall I like them. For the first time in a bethesda title multiple npc's can be involved in a signle conversation making for much more realistic and engageing dialogue with npc's.<br><br><br>And now for the other side:<br>Cons:<br><br>- Half the keybinds are not rebindable by default and need mods to enable their rebinding, for right handed people you may not even notice this issue, but for left handed people it will likly pose an issue. There are already looking to be mods aiming to fix this, but it is an issue.<br><br>- The pipboy ui is overall fairly good, but it is slightly zoomed in for bigger font, which could have been reduced in size for the pc release.<br><br><br>Overall, the game itself it spectacular, and is becoming on of my favorite Bethesda titles very rapidly. And it's onyl real qualms are issues like the keybinds which can rapidly and easily be modded out. What matters most to me is the core game experience is fun, enjoyable, and has so much variety I'm overwhelmed. I'd easily recommend this to any interested in a game that can provide untold hours of fun and exploration in a beautifully crafted world.								</div>

																<div class="content ">Because it's a question everyone must have answere; No. This is not Pay2win, at all.<br><br>Honestly, I am impresed by the devs for how entirely fair, almost too fair they are with their model. You get everythign free, even the expansions, something subscription mmo's even charge for (40-60 bucks too) with the only purchasable things being exp boosts, cosmetics, and character account services.<br><br>This game has been an utter surprise to me. I played it years back when it came out and I for some reason didn't click with it and I'm sad I wasn't fair in giving it a chance, as revisiting this I feel I've found a real gem in this game.<br><br>I have, in the past two days put in over 15 hours. And I'm still having so much fun. the combat is absolutely incredible, really it is. Even as something like a mage (sorcerer) you feel in peril and skill is an actualy thing that can shine through in your performance.<br><br>The art is beautiful, environments, characters, and armor all look amazing. i really can with ease recommend this game. just give it a chance, and I'm fairly sure if you're looking for exciting enjoyable combat that can actually pose a challenge to you, then this is the game.								</div>

																<div class="content ">So, I said I'd edit my review after Square patched the game, and while late, here it is:<br><br>This game is honestly good, and it frusterates me.<br><br>This game has this reputation on the itnernet of being this horrible, mindless romp down a narrow hallway. All that speaks to me is ignorance on the part of the speaker. Linear year, and the opening hours of the game play as described above<br><br>However, there's the kicker, it doesn't stay that way. It's combat is genuinely refreshing to experience, once the game let's you play it. It's more macro management in a fast paced and in cases demanding combat system. Boss fights can be intense and thrilling and the summons are, for once, not game winning buttons, but instead just another tool in your toolbox, which is very refreshing indeed. This honestly may be one of my favorite turn based systems purely for how well it all works together once it fills out mechanically a few hours in. It's such a breath of fresh air to such an old genre, while still remaining within it's roots.<br><br>The linearity is still a &quot;problem&quot; for much of the game, but I put it in quotes as I think people use that word without thinking on the use first. This game is as linear as 10 or 9 were, both of which are games I've beaten, 10 several times. In fact in many, many cases (after those awkward first hours of a LITERAL hallway) this game is LESS linear than those others. The airship especially impressed me as a &quot;linear&quot; portion that had a lot of paths to move thru and optional portions.<br><br>The problem is this game never &quot;stops&quot; in 9 and 10 you had cities that would break up the narrative, give you a big area to meander around in, and essentially kick back. I think this is where people accept 9 and 10 for being linear but not 13. Because of the narrative 13 can't be linear like it's brethren. And there's not really any moments of &quot;rest&quot;.<br><br>With all this in mind if I had to give a number I'd put this at a 7 or possibly 8 ot of 10. The opening hours are poorly designed and handled, and they needed to make combat more interesting in those opening hours to hook people.<br><br>But a game is not it's introduction. I am rateing this game as a WHOLE. And with everything, it is absolutely above average within the turn based jrpg genre. There's a lot of ideas that are interesting and enjoyable here. And while it's type of story is not for everyone, I personally love the story and it's characters.<br><br>If you're fine with a slow few hours to start this is genuinely a unique little gem of a game, and I can highly recommend giving it a shot.<br><br>I simply have one request. Make your own opinions of the game by playing it. Don't let others think and decide for you.While flawed this doesn't deserve to be called &quot;bad&quot;. That is saved for things like Garry's Incident and War Z.								</div>
