																<div class="content ">App Game Kit is a game creating app which lets you create a variety of different types of games with ease. The app includes a compiler which complies the games into windows, android, iOS and other such platforms. The program comes with an IDE which is based off of Codeblocks IDE. I really liked the IDE, it has some awesome features such as parameter suggestions, auto completion of commands etc. <br><br>Unlike other ‘easy’ game makers out there which feature GUI’s and drag and drop and other WSYWYG stuff, this game creation app relies on your coding entirely. You have to know programming if you want to create a game with this app. The engine uses a custom modified version of BASIC programming language. The syntax is very similar to C. This BASIC version of App Game Kit is called tier 1 programming. <br><br>You can also program in C++ with Game App Kit as a library. This gives you great power as you can use the power of C++ with the App Game Kit features. This is called tier 2 programming. With tier 2 programming you can use the object orientation of C++ with App Game Kit.<br><br>I am a complete beginner programmer with some basic knowledge of C++ and some basic knowledge and experience in Python programming. This app is the easiest game development I have used so far. The documentation in the app is very good that anything you want to know, you can just look it up and it will be present with examples. Though if they implemented the help guide in the program itself that would’ve been much better. At this point the help documentation is HTML based and opens in your browser. It’s kind of annoying having to switch between your browser and IDE to just read the help or guides. You are also provided with example apps such as different fonts properties app which displays all the things you can do with a text object. You are given the source code, so you can open it up in AGK and mess around with it, if you don’t know what a certain command does, simple moving the cursor over the command and pressing F1 key would open up the help page file to that exact command. The guide also includes some basic examples of the most common things.<br><br>You can also find plenty of help on the Game Creators’ community forums website. The community is very helpful and when I wanted some help with something I was doing, the people even went as far as to correct my 100+ lines of code. The community is pretty active and the mods themselves are pretty knowledgeable and make sure that the beginner sections’ questions are answered. You can of course also ask questions in the AGK Steam community forums as well.<br><br>The DLC’s of this include some Royalty asset packs which include both 2D and 3D assets. A few eBooks which come in PDF file format. Including beginners tier 1 tutorials and advanced tier 2 guides. There’s also a free DLC called Educational Materials pack. <br><br>There’s a lot of different Physics properties available, lots of 3D features, particle generators. Etc. available which can be attached to any object. You can create all sorts of neat effects using all these properties. The best part about AGK is you basically have to write a code and you can deploy your game to many platforms. Windows, Linux, iOS, Android and even Blackberry platforms, even HTML 5 is an option. This is a really nice feature if you are planning on distributing your games to multiple platforms.<br><br>There are of course some limitations as well of this software, for example no 64-bit data types are present such as a long long, doubles etc. Basically very few types of games require 64-bit date types anyways, such as high numbers counting/incremental games. This limitation can be overcome by using more than 1 variable. Another problem I found was the resolution are not dynamic (or maybe I haven’t figured it out yet). I made a project which was made in my desktop native resolution of 900p. When I played that game on a different PC with lower resolution, the sprites did not fit well. There is a percentage based virtual resolution feature which should fix this problem but it’s a bit harder to understand but it does fix this problem. Another problem I noticed is the Fonts of text objects. You can’t use normal fonts. The fonts have to be in an image file along with an image mapping text file which tells the program which letter is at which place on the image. This is not a major problem per say but I can be a bit inconvenient if you want to import your own text. You have to get a community made program which turns fonts into these image files which can be used in AGK. I had problems with this though I could find some pre-made fonts on the game creators forums. <br><br><b><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion:</div></b><br><br>Overall I am very impressed with this software and so far this has been the easiest for me to write code with. I would as far as put this alongside Python in the ease of use department. I highly recommend this software if you want to start coding for games and learn programming at the same time. This app did clear up a lot of the confusions I had with general programming e.g. I had a sort of “memory leak” problem when I starting coding which I found out was caused by putting a “Create Sprite” command inside a do loop, which continuously kept adding new sprites on top of another sprite until the FPS started to choke. This really taught me not to create object inside the main loop.								</div>

																<div class="content ">INSIDE is a sidescrolling platformer made by Playdead, who also made Limbo. The game will feel very familiar if you have played Limbo back in the day. The gameplay mechanics and even to some degree, the atmosphere feels similar. The game looks and sounds absolutely beautiful. <br><br><u><b><div class="bb_h1">Graphics:</div></b></u><br><br>The game features one of the best looking visuals I have seen on a sidescoller game. The graphics are somewhat simplistic, the characters don’t even have face features, they all just have a blank face and that’s probably the art-style chosen deliberately by the developers to convey their vision of the game. To add that mood and atmosphere to the game. The game always ran on 60 FPS for me, not a drop at any time. The FPS are locked at 60 FPS.<br><br><u><b><div class="bb_h1">Sound:</div></b></u><br><br>Like the graphics, the sounds are minimal too but as an aritisic choice. The ambient music, the minimalistic sounds really add to the already creepy atmosphere of the game. In the intense moments of games such as enemies chasing you and closing in on you, heartbeat sounds can be heard which really add to the whole creepy experience of the game.<br><br><u><b><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay:</div></b></u><br><br>Similar to Limbo, you just start off in the game and nothing is explained. The story is left up to the users to interpret. INSIDE starts off with you, a boy, dropped off in a forest. You start going forward, only to find out that you’re being hunted and the people in the background are looking for you and upon sighting, you they will chase you down and kill you. They have dogs as well who will relentlessly chew you down when they catch you. These enemies are usually in the background but they can spot you and run towards you to the foreground.<br><br>Similar to Limbo, you have almost exactly the same running patter, you can jump very similarly and can drag objects, open doors and grab onto ledges to pull yourself up etc. That’s the basic movement in this game. There are new puzzle types introduced in this game like the mind controlling of the almost zombie like humans. The puzzles themselves are not hard at all and at most take 2-3 attempts before you figure them out. There are a few longer puzzles too, one for example require you wandering in at least 4 places looking for more zombie mind controllable humans.<br><br>The game’s setting can be really atmospheric. Some segments which are underwater or segments with dogs chasing after you in a short space can make you feel downright claustrophobic. To avoid any spoilers, I will not go in detail about what sort of puzzles there are as most of the puzzles are only used once in the game. So you can expect plenty of different types of puzzles in the game.<br><br>There are forest sections in the game, the inside of different buildings sections, underwater sections, there’s even underground sections. Some sections such as a test lab and other various environments can be found in the game, all of which look beautiful. You also get to play as a different character(s), at the end of the game, I won’t say which to avoid spoilers. The game is said to have 2 endings but I have only seen the one which was quite weird to be honest.<br><br>A short gameplay video can be found below, though I’d advice not to watch it if you are planning on buying as it will spoil some part of the game for you.<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=741640250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_0">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=741640250</a><br><br><b><u>Graphics: 10/10</u></b><br><b><u>Sound: 9/10</u></b><br><b><u>Gameplay: 9/10</u></b><br><b><u>Overall: 9/10</u></b><br><br><u><b><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion:</div></b></u><br><br>The game is absolutely gorgeous to look at and sounds incredible. It’s an experience you most likely won’t forget soon. Simply said, it’s a masterpiece and a must play for people who like atmospheric and tense games. People who enjoyed Limbo will definitely enjoy this game too. The game is pretty short, about 3 hours of gameplay total, so if you think the price is high for that much content you can always wait for a sale and get the game when it’s cheaper.								</div>

																<div class="content ">SEUM Is a fast paced speed runner and a platformer game combined in first person view. I think the best way to describe the game would be as the developers themselves say, Super Meat boy combined with the crazy maneuverability of Quake games. Hell (no pun intended), even the logo of the game is a straight up reference to Doom. Many concepts in this are derived from the old FPS arena shooter games and that’s a good thing. <br><br><u><div class="bb_h1">Graphics:</div></u><br><br>The game looks pretty nice to look at. Atmosphere is right on point and really feels like you’re in the depths of the earth. The game still has that old Doom/Quake/Unreal Tournament vibe in the art department. While the graphics are much improved the whole art-style is reminiscing of these incredible games. As a huge fan of older Quake and other arena shooting games I enjoyed this look of the game in SEUM. The graphics menu doesn’t have a lot of options. There’s quality presets which go from low to ultra, v-sync, resolution adjustment etc. There is field of view adjustment available too which goes all the way up to 90. Overall the game ran very smooth for me and for such a game it’s a requirement to have fast smooth action because every millisecond counts. I got over 60 FPS throughout the time I played the game.<br><br><u><div class="bb_h1">Sound:</div></u><br><br>The game has pretty neat sound. As expected you will find heavy metal sound track are pretty good. Not my cup of tea but it was quite nice the ones I heard. In addition to that Satan will continuously talk to you as well, saying some stuff which can be quite funny.<br><br><u><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay:</div></u><br><br>Gameplay is as simple as it can get. The level select screen starts off with you being able to select one of the 10 levels (you can choose in any order you want). You have to finish all these 10 levels in order to unlock the elevator which takes you 1 level below into the depths of hell.  When you finish the next 10 levels you get to go down another level of hell. This goes on for 100 total stages in 10 levels of hell. Naturally as you progress downwards, the levels get harder and downright brutal. Every 10th stage of a level is a boss fight. These usually require more platforming skills and are longer compared to your average stage. There are also hidden (or hard to reach) beer collectibles which you can collect as well.<br><br>When starting a stage, you cannot move unless you click your left mouse button, again, just like the arena shooters spawn mechanic. Once clicked you’re dropped in the map/arena and you have to reach your goal which is a blue colored portal. There is a timer which you have to beat in order to actually beat the stage. Although when the timer runs out, nothing happens you’re free to stay in the map and do whatever you want but when you actually get to the finishing portal it’ll say you’re too slow and to retry again. This is good to explore the map and strategize your movements, in the later levels when things get complicated, you’d need this. There’s also a sort of a 3 stars’ system, except in this you have 3 versions of Satan. Normal, flaming and super flaming Satan. The quicker you finish a stage the better your ranking. You’re also placed in the leaderboards and compare your times with your friends.<br><br><br>To get through the various traps, spikes, lava pits, pendulums and many other obstacles and objects your character can jump and depending on how long you hold the jump button the longer you can jump. If you want a very short jump you can just tap the button. The jump and in-air time really matters as you consistently have to use the longer or shorter jump to avoid obstacles or projectiles being thrown at you. <br><br>Your character has a main fire ball attack. When you throw these fireballs they will travel in an arc sort of like a grenade launcher in many games. Your fire balls have many uses such as turn on fire switches which you simply shoot and they light up, these can open up gates. There are blocks which only appear when you shoot at them with your fireball later in the game. Other things such as mine bombs can also be destroyed with your fire attack. The power ups can also be picked up with your fireball.<br><br>There are many types of power ups you can pick which are required in the maps to be able to reach your goal. In the first levels you get the anti-gravity power pickup. This can make you fly so to speak. You can fly up in air by pressing the right mouse button and when you let go, you’ll fall down. Another power up is the teleportation power pick up, which throws a teleportation ball in an arc and wherever it lands you’ll get transported to that place. Right clicking again will immediately transport you to wherever the ball is in the air.<br><br>Another power up is the split ball. Upon picking up that you have the ability to split into 2 or sort of set a checkpoint of yourself and then right clicking again brings you back to the point you split off. This is used to power on switches and go back quickly or access places where you cannot go back from. E.G you have switches on the lower ground which you can jump to but cannot jump back up, so you have to rely on the split power up and set up a split point before you jump down there (an example of this can be found in the gameplay video below). Other power ups are also available such as a speed boost etc.<br><br>There are a couple of other modes as well. There’s the speed run mode which can be unlocked for each 10 levels. These are basically the same levels as the story levels but you get to speed run them. Other mode is the endless mode which is sort of like those endless runner games such as Temple Run except this is way too hard. You have a wall of spikes chasing you and you have to keep running, your score is measured in terms of the distance you travel. This mode randomly generates obstacles and throws different obstacles, spikes, pendulums and other things at you. This mode is pretty hard.<br><br>A short gameplay can be found below, please excuse the terrible aim. I played the game with in-home streaming with a regular mouse, different DPI from my main gaming mouse so things were a bit off.<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=740580771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_1">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=740580771</a><br><br><u><b>Graphics: 8/10</b></u><br><u><b>Sound: 7/10</b></u><br><u><b>Gameplay: 9/10</b></u><br><u><b>Overall: 9/10</b></u><br><br><u><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion:</div></u><br><br>Very fun game for fans of platformer games, who like a challenge. This is basically a 3d version of Super meat boy with some elements similar to 10 Seconds Ninja X, while some puzzle elements thrown in there too which are similar to Portal or other first person puzzler games. The game is pretty good to look at and if you’re also a fan of the old Quake movements, you will like this game. It’s an homage to games such as Quake, Doom, Unreal Tournament and it does justice to them. Even though this is more of a puzzler/platformer game, it reminded me of those good old arena shooter days. Plenty of content and achievements. I was very impressed with this game and highly recommend it.								</div>

																<div class="content ">Crusaders of the lost idols is a clicker/idle game which is somewhat different from your conventional clicker game. The game has massive amounts of content. The game has very good concepts and interesting gameplay mechanics.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Graphics:</div><br>The game features 2D nice looking cartoony graphics. They're certainly not very graphics intensive. The characters have a cute look to them and the game is pretty colorful and gorgeous to look at. The game seems to be locked at 30FPS, it's really an idle/clicker game so FPS doesn't really matter that much but in my opinion the slower FPS rate does make the game look a bit choppy. There is a &quot;low quality&quot; toggle so you can put it on low quality models to get more performance out of it. I also noticed blurry graphics and black bars when in full screen mode so playing in a windowed mode is ideal. The game is also 4:3 ratio, this can be improved by the developer in my opinion.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Sound:</div><br>The game has an awesome soundtrack (yes as far as I know there is only one sound track) and it sounded pretty nice and fun. Let's be honest, no one plays an idle/clicker game to listen to the music so after a while you're probably going to mute the audio anyways. The sound of clicking (sword sound) isn't too nice but I guess it doesn't really matter as mentioned before you'd probably mute the sound after a while because the game is usually idling most of the time.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay:</div><br>The gameplay of this game can be pretty overwhelming when you start, compared to your standard clicker game. You have goals, when you start a game you're given an objectives screen where you select a mission and go for the goal of that objective. You can also continue even if you have achieved the goal and keep going forward in levels. So there isn't any such restriction that you have to get your mission goal and start another mission right away. The point of this is so you can continue playing and try to get as maximum number of players' levels so you can earn maximum number of idols. You get Rubies and other things like unlock a Crusader (from events) as a reward for completing these missions. These rubies can be used to purchase jewel chest.<br><br>The game also features a free play mode where you can play without any objective and try to go for the maximum level and/or farm for idols. You get no Rubies reward in free play though. The main way to power up your crusaders is to earn idols. You get 1 idol for every time you level up your crusader to 500. Each idol increases all your crusaders' DPS by 3% and gold found by 1%. So collecting a lot of idols can really make your entire crusaders team stronger and you can go to higher levels as a result. The idols can be spent in the idol shop to buy ‘Talents’, which are also permanent upgrades.<br><br>The game's levels are different compared to say, Clicker Heroes, where when you kill x number of enemies you advance to the next level. In this game you have these mini missions for example, collect x number of shells, collect x number of mushrooms, collect x number of water bottles etc. All these mini missions are theme based e.g. if you're in the beach area you get to collect fishes, shells, if you're in the desert area you get to collect water and similar things. The theme changes every 10 levels and after every 5 levels you get a boss battle. At one point in game unlocking and leveling up a crusader called ‘Nate Dragon’, you will get a ‘End of the world’ ability which will do a soft reset and earning you idols and starting the game over again. This will also conclude any objective you have finished and reward you with rubies or whatever the reward was for that said objective.<br><br>You can hire crusaders in this game and you have a formation pattern where the crusaders can be placed. The number of spots is limited so not all heroes can be active at the same time. So you must choose your best possible crusaders combination. If your main goal is to get as much goal as possible, you go with the crusaders which multiply your gold. If you're trying to do maximum damage per second you choose the highest DPS crusaders. Different missions give you different formation patterns and some missions can block off parts of the formations. Like one of the missions has you running away from 4 killer rabbits and these rabbits block off 4 of the 10 spots on the formation, so you're crippled by this and can only take 6 crusaders on the mission. The placement of crusaders also matters as some crusaders have certain types of formation placement bonuses, like one of the crusader ‘Khouri’ has an upgrade which increases DPS of all the crusaders next to him by 45% and also an upgrade which heals the crusaders by 30% of their maximum health every second in the next line in the formation.<br><br>There's 20 total crusaders which come standard and then there are some crusaders which can be unlocked from these events the game developer does from time to time. The crusaders can earn gold by killing enemies and also earn experience points. The longer the crusader is in the formation the more experience points he/she will earn. E.g. if a crusader is in formation for 5 hours, it will gain an experience point which will give him DPS boost etc.<br><br>The crusaders have upgrades which can be accessed by leveling them up, this is the similar to the other clicker games such as Clicker Heroes. Upgrades such as increase the crusaders DPS by x percent, increase gold found by x percent etc. In addition to that these crusaders get these gear slots. When you open chests you have a chance to find a gear card for these crusaders, this can range from common, uncommon, rare to epic etc. This gear increases the crusaders stats permanently i.e. these won't reset even if you reset the world. If you find a duplicate card and you already have that gear card, these duplicate cards are enchanted which gives you enchantment points or ‘EP’. Each EP gives the crusader 25% bonus DPS. The crusaders also have abilities like &quot;automatically perform 15 clicks per second&quot;, &quot;freeze all enemies for 5 seconds&quot; etc. These have a cool down after using them. The crusaders which unlock these abilities must be in the formation in order to use the abilities.<br><br>The regular chests can be found by killing bosses and the jewel chests can be bought for rubies or real life money. The regular chests give you 3 cards. These cards can have gear for your crusaders, x amount of gold found or a power boost card. While the jeweled chests give you 5 cards and i think there is at least 1 guaranteed gear card in these.<br><br>There are also power boost cards which are found in the chests. These can be activated at will and give the crusaders certain types of boosts. E.g. there is a damage boost. Other such boosts include earn x percent of gold, make the enemies spawn faster by x percent, do x percent of immediate damage to all enemies etc.<br><br>There are achievements which also increase your crusaders’ stats. You can open up chat in game and ask for help, the people I ran into when I started playing were plenty helpful and really did answered all my questions I had. So the community is also pretty nice in this game as far as I have seen. There is a guidebook feature also present which should be pretty handy when starting up. <br><br>A short gameplay video can be found below:<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=738274058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_2">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=738274058</a><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion:</div><br>The game is very fun and if you enjoy clicker games, you will definitely enjoy this one. It's a free game so you have nothing to lose if you try this game. It has enough changes from the conventional clicker games that it warrants a play through. The game requires some understanding and can be a bit overwhelming when starting out but once you get the hang of what everything does it can be a breeze to play afterwards. There is a massive amount of content in this game and should keep you occupied for hours.								</div>

																<div class="content "><b><div class="bb_h1">Note: I was provided a key of this game for review purposes. This does not change my views and opinions on the game. </div></b><br><br>Demon Hunter 2 is a hidden object casual game published by Artifex Mundi. It’s a pretty good game for killing time and I like some of the puzzles in the game. You play as “Dawn Foster” who is a demon hunter and is the last remaining one in her family. While the game can be pretty easy most of the time you’re either doing find the hidden objects mini games or moving around different places looking for clues and trying to save yourself from the demon “Ragnar”. The story can be cheesy but it’s good enough to have you sit through the entire game which isn’t that long.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Graphics and sound:</div><br>The graphics are your average run of the mill standard hidden object finder games’ graphics. The hand painted art is nice though and good looking. There are cringe worthy and yet hilarious character models and speaking animations (are these deliberate?). The game runs at a solid 60 FPS, there seem to be no problems in the performance as well.<br>The voice overs are not the best similar to the speaking animations but then again I think this is deliberate. They still do their job telling the story and interacting with other characters etc. The music, however is very good and kept me playing the game and had that mysterious feeling which is pretty well representative of a hidden object game.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay:</div><br>The game has simple hidden object finding mini games. You go into different rooms and different places and find things which unlock other rooms and stuff. The demon tries to kill you many ways like with an RPG, car bomb etc. but you have this pendant which protects you. <br><br>There are also mini games which can be skipped but I never skipped any as these can be pretty fun to solve. Most of them are pretty easy and can be done in a minute or two. Other than the standard hidden object finding mini games you also get mini games similar to a hidden object game but instead of finding the objects you must place the objects in their appropriate place as shown in by its silhouette. <br><br>You go through many locations such as streets, houses, basements, closets, hospital, surgery room etc. All these locations are beautifully hand painted. The puzzles are pretty clever and most of the time you would know what to do with each item unlocking something else.<br><br>A short gameplay including a couple of mini games can be found below:<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=733624147" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_3">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=733624147</a><br><br><u><b>Scorecard:</b></u><br>1) Stay away<br>2) Not Recommended<br><u><b>3) Only recommended when on sale</b></u><br>4) Recommended<br>5) Highly recommended<br>6) This is a must play<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion:</div><br>Pretty fun game but kind of short as well. The gameplay is nice and story is also okay-ish. Not the best story, but will keep you entertained with it’s hilarious dialog and character animations. Due to the short gameplay nature I’d recommend picking this up during a sale or only if you’re a big fan of the hidden object finding games genre.								</div>

																<div class="content "><b><div class="bb_h1">EDIT - Review updated 07/26/2016:</div></b><br><br>After my initial review yesterday, the developer has worked on and released a patch for the game which has dramatically fixed a lot of the issues. The camera in the third person is much better now and i noticed no focus loss. The track &quot;Long beach&quot; has had some sort of graphical and lighting change which makes it looks much better and brighter and the FPS i got in-game were also 100+ FPS now.<br><br>The game really has potential and the developers are pretty active as they fixed most of the issues i had within a day and hopefully they work on sound and more race tracks and make the game even better. I would recommend this game now! I have also updated my score up above as per the new improved game.<br><br><b><div class="bb_h1">Note: I was provided a key for this game by “TeamTom Reviews”, who, in turn received the key from the publishers. This does not change my views and opinions on the game.</div></b><br><br>GI racing 2.0 is a racing game which tries to do too many things at once and fails at all of them. The game is in Early Access and it clearly shows it’s not complete yet. The game tries to be an arcade racer yet has features of a realistic racing simulation game. The controls feel floaty and the game runs pretty bad too with stuttering.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Graphics:</div><br>The game’s graphics are pretty bad and look so dull and gloomy. I didn’t like the way the game looked at all. The game’s pretty bad in optimization as I had ~35-40FPS throughout the gameplay. I noticed stuttering as well.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Sound:</div><br>Music is nonexistent apart from the main menu, you won’t hear a thing in races other than the obnoxiously loud engine sound (yes, I turned the ‘car’ volume almost all the way down in the options menu already). <br><br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay:</div><br>Gameplay is your standard races in different maps. There seem to be only 2 different tracks. These tracks come in different variations e.g. a track could be in day time, night time, or day time with wet track etc. There’s a quick play mode where you can select a track and just start playing right away or go for the ‘Tournament’ mode if you have the patience.<br><br>The controls feel very floaty and the camera is all over the place. If you play in the cockpit view mode, it’s not that bad but for someone who prefers the third person behind the car camera angle it can be problematic.There's a camera problem, when you press brake fast and try to turn, the camera goes out of focus on the car and you cannot see your car and cannot make adjustments to make the turn properly. There are many other problems such as the car sliding out of control at just even touching the other car at slow speeds, so physics is also not the best in the game. When you turn or move right and left the car feels like it’s strafing left and right and not turning. <br><br>I usually don’t give such harsh reviews but in this game’s case I had to. I only played 20 minutes and I couldn’t take it anymore. Just look at the gameplay video posted below as words can’t describe these. Check out my attempt to play a serious game and giving up.<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=731066527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_4">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=731066527</a><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Suggestions for the developer to improve the game:</div><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>You need to improve the game’s performance, I can run games that are much better looking at 60 FPS or above. <br></li><li>Fix the camera angle problem.<br></li><li>Add some soundtracks and please make the engine sound a bit quieter. <br></li><li>Car’s turning doesn’t feel natural, make it so it doesn’t feel like car is strafing left and right and actually turning. <br></li><li>Either be an arcade racer or be a simulation racer, don’t try to do both things at once. <br></li><li>When going the wrong way, a message should appear telling the player they’re going In the wrong direction. <br></li><li>Add more tracks.</li></ul>I hope you can improve your game and I wish you all the best!<br><br><br><b><u>Graphics: 7/10</u></b><br><b><u>Sound: 3/10</u></b><br><b><u>Gameplay: 7/10</u></b><br><b><u>Overall: 7/10</u></b><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion:</div><br>If you’re looking for a racing game, look elsewhere. In this state the game is almost unplayable (at least for me it was). The graphics suck, the optimization is horrible, the sound sucks, $13 for this game is a bit steep, maybe pick it up when on sale. I feel pretty bad giving an indie developer such a harsh review but it had to be done.								</div>

																<div class="content "><div class="bb_h1"><b>Note: I was provided with a key for this game from “TeamTom Reviews”, who in turn received the key from the publishers. This does not change my opinion on the game itself. </b></div><br>Infinium Strike is a space tower defense game. It’s not your typical tower defense game as it’s based in space and you have this huge ship which you must defend against the Wrogs. You can setup turrets on your ship and have several other things like drone ships which help you defend against the Wrogs.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Graphics:</div><br>The graphics are pretty average, it’s a space based strategy/tower defense game so you should expect boring dark visuals. While the backgrounds and effects look nice the ship itself looks horrible. The graphics menu has many options so you can lower the graphics if you don’t have a powerful GPU. There’s not a problem in performance of the game as I played on extreme detailed options without any problems with over 100 FPS all the time.<br><div class="bb_h1">Sound:</div><br>The music in this game is great though. From the moment you launch the game and you hear that epic battle almost Star Wars like music, you get hooked. The narration is also pretty nice though it seemed sometimes that the narrator was bored.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay:</div><br>You have this huge ship called the Freedom Strike. You can place turrets on it and send out drones to attack the incoming enemy. The enemy will attack from all 4 sides and you have the ability to add turrets on all 4 quadrants of your ship. You also have a strategic view which shows a top down blurpeint of your ship and where the enemies are. This is super useful as a lot of enemies can be attacking you at a time and this helps you figure out which quadrant you should focus on. The main currency of the game which you use to purchase towers and upgrade them is called Infinium. When you kill enemies they will drop Infinium which your ship automatically collects.<br><br>The enemies and turrets are sort of like rock paper scissors. One turret kills one range of enemy ship but cannot kill others. Certain turrets can destroy projectiles while special types of turrets are required to kill the bigger ships in range 3. So you have to figure out which turret is best for which enemy range. You can upgrade turrets as well and as expected every level of upgrade costs more than previous. New turrets get unlocked when you upgrade Freedom Strike. Turrets like rail gun, super pulse rifle etc.  Upgrading the Freedom Strike gives armor/shield bonuses as well as new turrets are unlocked for purchasing.<br><br>You can also deploy drone machines called TSF fleet. These come in different varieties too, one of these turrets kills the furthest and biggest enemy ships, while the other kills normal enemies which are closer. The last of these targets enemy projectiles only. These TSF fleets can be upgraded which costs points. To spawn new drones, you also need these points. These points charge overtime.<br><br>There are also the TSF supertech bonuses. These give you extra help with your missions and include things like the super salvage which doubles the rate at which infinium is collected, or the super shield which insta-charges your shields. These have a cool down and cannot be used unless the cool down period has expired. There are other things as well like the Sentry Sattelite which deploys a stationary satellite which shoots at the enemies in a certain range.<br><br>A short gameplay video of a round can be found below:<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=730464150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_5">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=730464150</a><br><br><b><u>Graphics: 7/10</u></b><br><b><u>Sound: 8/10</u></b><br><b><u>Gameplay: 5/10</u></b><br><b><u>Overall: 6/10</u></b><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion:</div><br>It’s a tower defense with a little bit of strategy games elements. I wasn’t impressed with the gameplay mechanics. The point that the turrets only kill enemies in a certain range is not that good. Enemies could be in range one and your super awesome pulse rifle cannot do anything about it and will only shoot at range 3 enemies. The game can also be pretty hectic in managing all 4 quadrants where you have to focus on stopping enemy projectiles, keeping a watch on your shield and armor, deploy the correct turrets for what the wave of enemies is, upgrading turrets, spawning the correct TSF Fleet drones etc. It seems more like a chore than gameplay. So buy it only if you really love space strategy games or the game is on sale.<br><br>								</div>

																<div class="content ">Dragon rage is a game similar to the classic Rampage series. You’re a dragon and all you have to do is cause chaos. The game has very cure art-style and some nice music. The game however is way too short, and I am talking like 20 minutes to complete the game short. It is fun though but I think the developer could’ve added a few more levels. <br><br><div class="bb_h1">Graphics and sound:</div><br>The graphics looks pretty awesome with a cartoony art-style. The screen looks sharp and crisp. The dragon and people are super cute as well.  In the sound department there isn’t much, the background track is okay, nothing too fancy. When you go in rage mode the track changes into metal-type music. The sound effects are pretty nice too.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay:</div><br>Basically you’re a dragon who is on rampage mode. You have to destroy a certain number of buildings and kill anyone who gets in the way, including knights, archers even the royal family itself. You can do certain types of moves including dashing, which will knock anyone in your way like a bowling ball. You can jump, stomp or breath fire down on the people. You also get many bonuses spawning and collecting them will give you food, points etc.<br><br>You have a health/hunger meter, whenever the dragon breath fire on people or stomp them it takes this bar down and to fill it up again you have to eat people. Throughout the game you have to manage your eating and destroying at the same time. When your health bar gets full you go into rage mode. In this mode the background gets all red and you can only see your dragon’s silhouette. You can dash infinitely in this mode and jump really high and breath fire faster too. Basically you can cause much more mayhem with this rage mode. Once in this mode the health bar starts depleting again and once the bar is empty you go back to the regular mode.<br><br>There’s also an egg meter which when it fills up the dragon will lay an egg. You must protect the egg for a certain time and dragon babies will hatch from the eggs. These little monsters will aid you in destroying everything that exists.<br><br>When you start off no one is attacking you. Once you start causing chaos the king will send knights to kill you and if they can’t stop you, archers will arrive. Later the king sends catapults, magicians, horse riding knights and many other types of warriors try to stop you. They even build walls so the dragon cannot move freely. the princess and queen come at a certain point in the game. They give defense bonuses to their armies. Once you destroy the king and 100 buildings, the game is over and you have won.<br><br>A short gameplay clip can be found below:<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=730123256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_6">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=730123256</a><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion:</div><br>The game itself if pretty fun. Think of it as a stress reliever. If you’re angry with some work stuff or real life, you can sit down and take your frustration down on the poor people of the kingdom. $7 is kind of steep though for this short of a game so you can always wait for a bigger sale.								</div>

																<div class="content "><div class="bb_h1"><b>Note: I was provided with a key for this game from “TeamTom Reviews”, who in turn received the key from the publishers. This does not change my opinion on the game itself. </b></div><br>Hunter’s Legacy is a side scrolling action platformer game with a hint of metroidvania thrown in there. The story is pretty cliché. You’re playing as the huntress cat called Ikki in the town of Iripur. Their ‘Fang of Alliance’ has been stolen by the evil Morodir and Ikki is the only one who can get it back. Without the Fang of Alliance their town is decaying evil is spreading. If Ikki is the huntress, the name of the game should’ve been Huntress’ Legacy in my opinion.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Graphics:</div><br>The game features sharp, cartoon-like graphics. The art-work is pretty nice and the game isn’t bad looking at all. The color scheme is also pretty neat, not the brightest colors but certainly not dull either. The game is locked at 60 FPS and I didn’t have problems with the FPS. There was occasional stutter though but I think that just might be my network connection (played using steam’s in-home streaming).<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Sound: </div><br>The music is nice in this game but there isn’t a lot of variety. The levels can be long so hearing the same music all the time can get boring, not to mention frustrating if you get stuck at a part in the game. The sounds of getting hit, blade hitting aren’t that good and in my opinion pretty bland. <br><br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay:</div><br>The gameplay is pretty interesting, it’s not the best platformer out there but it definitely isn’t bad either. You play as the huntress cat Ikki. Your main goal is to get the Fang of Alliance back from Morodir. You go after him and he runs away and seals the entrance after him. This entrance can only be opened if the 3 orbs represented on the seal are found and brought there. So Ikki goes on the journey to find these Orbs. She has a sword attack and a bow which can shoot arrows. Later down the game you can upgrade these and you can upgrade your bow to shoot arrows which you can charge by holding the attack button. You can climb up on ledges, break blocks, grass with the sword and shoot arrows in any direction. You can also roll around to dodge enemies’ attack. You also gain a down strike later in the game which can be used to access areas which previously couldn’t be accesses by breaking special blocks using this ability.<br><br>There’s a lot of variety of enemies, from slow slugs to bees to cactuses to the most annoying enemy ever, the flying elves.  These guys can shoot you through walls and you can’t do anything about it other than trying to doge their super-fast projectiles. Some enemies can only be killed using the charged arrows shots which can be annoying as shooting the arrows at the right place can be a bit wonky as you have to hold the fire button and adjust the aim and then shoot, this can be difficult in the heat of battle. <br><br>There’s checkpoints at regular intervals so that’s a good thing. There’s also teleporters in levels which save your game and act like checkpoints so that’s a bonus. You can use these teleporters to go to any level you have previously been in. You also get a map where you can see all the locations you have visited already and areas you haven’t been to yet. You can go into the town itself and talk to people, sort of like an RPG. <br><br>You can cut grass with your sword and break blocks as well. Doing these can get you extra arrows you can use or fishes which restore some of your health. You also get coins from chests and sometimes in the grass. These coins can be used to purchase upgrades and health fill-ups from the town. Weapon upgrades can also be purchased at the town and so can health upgrades. These upgrades require ores as well as coins. The coins can be found easily but these ores can be a pain to find. I played almost halfway through the game and I had not found any ore’s yet. At the start your money bag has a limit of 300 which can be expanded by finding secret areas with these small leprechaun type creatures who ask for some money for some mysterious item. They will give you bags which can hold more money. The same case with the arrows bag. The game can get difficult in the later levels but mostly due to the fact that some enemies are super annoying and cheap.<br><br>That pretty much sums up the gameplay, if you have any questions please feel free to ask in the comments section of this review. A short gameplay video can be found below:<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729950143" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_7">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729950143</a><br><br><b><u>Graphics: 7/10</u></b><br><b><u>Sound: 5/10</u></b><br><b><u>Gameplay: 7/10</u></b><br><b><u>Overall: 6/10</u></b><br><br><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion:</div><br>The game has pretty average gameplay and story. Length wise you can expect 6-7 hours of gameplay and if you try to find the secret locations or do the achievements you can get 10 hours of play time.								</div>

																<div class="content ">Cue Club 2: Pool and Snooker is the sequel to the original Cue Club game which was released in 2000 by Bulldog Interactive. It’s a game which features many game modes related to pool and snooker. This game improves almost everything from the first game but on the other hand also skips on somethings that were available in the first Cue Club. Now, for me it was one of the best childhood memories. playing those Cue Club virtual tournaments and trying to beat the AI in the game and virtual chatting with the AI. Such nostalgia.<br><br> <div class="bb_h1">Graphics:</div><br>The game looks absolutely beautiful. The graphics are clean and detailed.  It’s a top down snooker/pool game and this type of art-style looks very good for it. The art-style is very similar to the first game but in this one is HD and it’s much more polished and has more eye candy. Some of the effect that were included in the first game seem to be missing, namely the strobing disco light effect. The game is locked at 60 FPS and I did not get any dips in performance throughout my gameplay.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Sound:</div><br>Cue Club 2 features very awesome soundtracks. These soundtracks, I can listen to them all day long. It’s sort of like club music but a bit slower paced. The sound of the cues, balls hitting other balls, even chalking your cue are good. Just listen to the music in the video posted below.<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Gameplay:</div><br>The gameplay is pretty simple and straight forward. The good part is the variety of things you can do. You can play 8 ball pool, 9 ball pool, 6 ball pool, killer pool, full snooker or 10 and 6 balls snookers. You can play against the AI or play 2 players locally taking turns each. The physics of the table cloth can be adjusted and the size of the balls can also be changed. The game’s physics is one of the best pool physics in a pool game I have seen. The AI opponents will say stuff like “nice shot” if you manage a good shot, which can be pretty entertaining. Another thing missing is the virtual chat option. That was one of the prominent features of the game and highly entertaining. As you could get in chats with the AI players and mess around.<br><br>There are tons of design choices you can select for almost everything in the game. You can change the table cloth color, the finish of the wood, the pattern on the table cloth. The balls size can be adjusted and plenty of different types of balls can be selected. You can even choose the color of your chalk. Many different types of cues are available as well. Even some match rules can be changed. All of these are unlocked and ready to use, so no more grinding to unlock these cosmetic items.<br><br>You can play different modes such as a tournament mode where you and several other virtual AI opponents will enter and there are fixtures just like a real snooker/pool tournament. Other than that there’s also bar mode where you start off in the lowest basement level bar and make your way up to a more expensive penthouse bar. The difficulty will increase as you progress to higher level bars. You can play solo as well. You can also play quick mode where you can just go and play any type of game with AI opponent. Another mode is solo mode. This has a game type called “Slam”. In this you can drag the cue ball with your mouse as if it were attached with a string and play that way. This mode was pretty fun. Other solo game types include speed pool mode where you have to clear the table as fast as you can and that time is recorded so you can come back and try to beat your own time. <br><br>A short gameplay video of a bar challenge game can be found below:<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729525708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"  id="dynamiclink_8">http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=729525708</a><br><br>1) Stay away<br>2) Not Recommended<br>3) Only recommended when on sale<br>4) Recommended <br><b><u>5) Highly recommended</u></b><br>6) This is a must play<br><br><div class="bb_h1">Conclusion:</div><br>If you have played the original Cue Club back in the day, you’re in for a pleasant surprise with this game. Even if you haven’t played it, this game is so amazing. One of the best pool/snooker games I have ever played. Super addicting, gorgeous with an amazing sound track. If you like pool/snooker in real life or in games media, then this is the game for you. The game has some nice achievements too.								</div>
